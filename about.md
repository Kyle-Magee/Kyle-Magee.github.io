I'm Kyle, hailing from a tiny southern town with a fascination for automation. 
I study Computer Science at Long Beach City College. Although most of my knowledge comes from my
[projects](https://kyle-magee.github.io/). I've travelled the inner workings of **Python**, 
the paved roads of **Flask** and the dark corners of **Web Scraping**. Along the way
I've realized the merits of writing clean code. These days I'm teaching myself machine learning and web
development. 

Computers have played a huge role in my life, learning more about them never gets boring.
