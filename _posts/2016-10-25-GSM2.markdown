GSM2 is an automated schedule creator for Goodwill managers. I've been working on this for a few months.
This began with a complaint from my store manager about the hassle of having to create a new schedule every week.

The idea is that the script finds the person that is:

 * qualified for the job

 * available for the job

This process is repeated until the day has all of its needs met. Then this information is put into an Excel Sheet to be
posted in the employee breakroom.

GSM2 only needs a work schedule with employee names to do its job but extra parameters are welcomed. Users can input
the days employees are unable to work and the positions an employee is qualified for.

I learned a lot about software design throughout this project. Designing the website in Flask and setting up the web server
taught me even more about web development. In the end I'm very proud of this project; I've already got ideas for new features.
